This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing real estate data using SQL queries. The dataset, sourced from NashvilleHousing, undergoes several transformations to enhance data quality and consistency.

My process was as follows:
1. Standardize Date Format
2. Populate Property Address Data
3. Break Out Address into Individual 
4. Owner Address Update
5. Change 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in "Sold as Vacant" Field
6. Remove Duplicates
7. Delete Unused Columns

   This series of SQL queries systematically cleans and enhances the NashvilleHousing real estate dataset.
   The steps include standardizing date formats, populating missing address data, breaking out address components, updating owner addresses, changing boolean values,
   removing duplicates, and dropping unused columns. The resulting dataset is more consistent and ready for further analysis.
